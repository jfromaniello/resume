These applications target a backend with very basic services as storage, publish/subscribe, queues, SMSs and authentication. This project is written in JavaScript and uses node.js, we used mongodb, rabbitmq and redis, and also some well-known libraries like socket.io and express.js.\r\n\r\n### GenWise *November 2009 to March 2011*\r\n**Smart@Data** developed the project using WPF, Castle Project, NHibernate, Prism and leaded architectural  decisions.
